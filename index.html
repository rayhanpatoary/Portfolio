                                In this Course I have Learned about the Research methodology.I Successfully Completed a Research work also. Title of the work was "Application for Diabetes
                                Prediction Based On Machine Learning".In my research work , my objective was to develop an optimized and efficient machine learning (ML)
                                application which can effectually recognize and predict the condition of the
                                diabetes. In this work, some most 6 important machine learning classification
                                techniques: Artificial Neural Network,Support Vector Machine,Logistics Regression,Decision Tree,Random Forest and Naive Bayes
                                was considered for predicting diabetes. However, I used
                                different evaluation criteria to investigate the performances of these classification
                                techniques. Performance measurement of the classification techniques was
                                evaluated by applying the 10-fold cross validation method.The analysis
                                results showed that Naive Bayes achieve the highest performance than the
                                other classifiers. Then , I Developed a sample Application Using Naive Bayes to predict diabetes.
                                End of the work I wrote a paper in IEEE format and Presented my work to the professor.

                                        University enrolled us to Cisco Networking Academy.We worked through the Cisco Networking Academy course material chapter by chapter. 
                                        After each chapter I took the chapter assignment.The total grade of each module was built of 20% chapter assignments, 50% Skills Test, 30% Final Exam.
                                        After Completing this course I got the CCNA Certification too.

                                            <br>Independent Course Work II-IOT(5 ECTS):<br>
                                            From this course I got Knowledge about Electrical circuits, Arduino Programming, Sensors and actuators, Operating systems, Programming the Gateway, esp. Bluetooth, Wireless Sensor Networks etc.
                                            Within this Project I did a project named "2x Self-Driving Robot".The goal of this project was to build a small self-driving robot that can follow a black line on the
                                            ground and can also be controlled manually with a small web interface(Left, Right, Forward). 
                                            The program that has the self-driving part runs on the Arduino. So the robot can drive without a
                                            connection to a computer. 
                                            The web interface runs on computer (or raspberry) and was written by my ownself. 
                                            That program can communicate with the robot via Bluetooth.

                    <h2 class="mb-5">Motivation</h2>
                    <p>   </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I am dedicated to deepening
                        my knowledge and passionate about it because I love capturing almost everything related to
                        Software Engineering. Company Size and Location isn't a matter for me.I have worked with small and large companies in the past. I know how to struggle with a startup company. Again, how to be responsible as an employee in a large company. 
                        I think my time is now to learn. So I'm interested in working wherever I can seem to learn.<br> </p>
                    <p class="mb-0"><br>During my study life, I have been studying on software engineering for almost five years. 
                        Therefore, besides programming, I have Learned things like system design, project management, requirements analysis and 
                        software Development methodologies very well. 
                        I think as a software engineer I shouldn‚Äôt just be a mobile app developer or web developer.Engineers should be able to prepare himself according to the Industrial demand. 
                        And I think I have that. So I don't want to define on which Technology I want to work in work place. I will do the tasks in what my employer will assign me.
                        If this is the case, after seeing my experience on the Android application, a company offered me an internship in Android development, then it would be a plus point for me.
                        <br><br> My plan is to work for long term wherever I get the chance. I have to do six months internship as per the requirements of my university. In other words, out of my total four semesters, the third semester is full time internship what I'm doing now at Carl Zeiss. 
                        And in semester fourth I have to write a master thesis. Which I can write in a company or I can write myself. 
                        I will write the master thesis under my proffesor. Beyond that I can work as a full time work student if I get the opportunity. Since I am on a student visa I am allowed to work 120 days full time. 
                        During this time I will finish my studies and if the company wants I can join as a full time employee. Therefore, the relationship will be for long-term not only for few months!
